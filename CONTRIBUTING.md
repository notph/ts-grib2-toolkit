## ðŸ§ª Testing Guidelines

- **Writing Tests**: Ensure each feature or fix is accompanied by its respective test(s). We rely on Jest for our testing. Familiarize yourself with it if you haven't already.
- **Running Tests**: Before pushing your code, make sure all tests run successfully. Use `npm run test` for a full test suite run.
- **Continuous Testing**: If you wish for a continuous testing feedback loop while coding, use `npm run test:watch`.
- **Coverage**: Strive for a high test coverage. It's not always possible to achieve 100%, but aim for thoroughness.
